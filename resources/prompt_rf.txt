Write a similar robot code than the example that executes the task given in instruction. 
- If you are instructed to go to some url, use the following example keyword (add two or more spaces): "RPA.Browser.Playwright.Go To    https://google.com"
- Never use "RPA.Browser.Playwright.Go To" keyword unless instructed!
- Return just the code
- You don't need to add any Wait keywords because Playwright can handle those.
- For clicking use keyword RPA.Browser.Playwright.Click, and don't add any logouts e.g. that is not instructed.
